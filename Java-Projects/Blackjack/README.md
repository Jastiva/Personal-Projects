This is my first project that has nothing to do with any tutorial or Udemy class.

TODO: Ace 1/11 mechanic, QA

A command line program that plays blackjack (2:1) with you. 

Currently a work in progress, I'm using it to teach myself the basics of Java and OOP in general.

Future things I'd like to add: UI, Database of users with username/password, Android App.

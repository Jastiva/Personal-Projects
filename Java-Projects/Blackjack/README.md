This is my first programming project ever that has nothing to do with any tutorial or Udemy class! 
Building this game has been a huge help in learning the ins and outs of OOP and Java itself. 
I highly recommend Tim Bulchalka's class, but once I got 1/3rd of the way through the class I needed to make something on my own.

TODO: split mechanic

A command line program that plays blackjack (2:1) with you!

Currently a work in progress. I started programming in Jan of '19 and started this on week 2 so this is very much a novice venture

Future things I'd like to add: UI, Database of users with username/password, Port onto Android App & post on Play Store, "Perfect play" table, "Perfect play" mode that teaches the player perfect strategy.
